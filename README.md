# Brain-Tumor-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning
## Objective
The objective of the project is to develop a deep learning model for the classification of brain
tumor images. Specifically, the project aims to utilize deep learning techniques, particularly
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to accurately classify brain MRI images into two
categories: tumorous and non-tumorous.
## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or later (recommended)
- Anaconda (for managing virtual environments and packages)
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab (for running and testing code interactively)
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, or Spyder.
- TensorFlow (version 2.x)
- Keras (included within TensorFlow 2.x)
- OpenCV (cv2)
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
## Installation
1. **Install Anaconda:**
   Download and install Anaconda from [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
2. **Create Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   conda create --name myenv python=3.7
   conda activate myenv
pip install tensorflow opencv-python pillow numpy scikit-learn
